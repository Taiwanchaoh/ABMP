function [Nearby] = Measure(Fleet,i,Constants)
% This function will output the position, velocity and distance of the air
% vehicles within the aware radius.

% Output: Nearby(k by 7) = [px,py,pz,vx,vy,vz,d];
%         k = total number of Air Vehicle within the radius

% Fleet = [type,Position,Volicity,Statue,size,Dest_type,Dest,TMission]
